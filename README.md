## Background
During the period of November 2018-January 2019, I undertook an research internship in the Hardware and Embedded Systems Lab at NTU, Singapore. Under the esteemed guidance of Dr Nirmala Radhkrishnan and Professor Thambipillai Srikanthan, I worked on building a tool to automatically detect and mark lanes in roads based on feed from surveillance cameras. Although the dataset I worked with is proprietory, the script I wrote is available here.
